# Tutorial: OuroborosFS

OuroborosFS is a *distributed file system* that stores data across a network of computers. It organizes these computers,
called **Nodes**, into a self-healing *ring*. Instead of storing an entire file in one place, it splits it into smaller
**chunks** and distributes them around the ring, ensuring the system can survive and automatically recover from computer
failures.
